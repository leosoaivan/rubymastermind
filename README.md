The Odin Project

Object-Oriented Programming with Ruby: Project 2

This is my solution to the Mastermind project, as part of <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop">The Odin Project's</a> Ruby curriculum.

The file `rubymm.rb` contains the first iteration, where the player simply plays against the computer Master Mind. The second iteration, `rubymm2.rb`, includes the ability for the human player to set the code for the computer to solve. The computer solves the code in about 4-5 guesses.
